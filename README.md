### TODO
next thing to do would be to pick a certain amount of items, maybe the 100 highest velocity, and pull current market price data for those items for each of those items.

i could pull price history to see what those items usually sell at.

i need to get the delta between the lowest listed price within the dc and somewhere its listed high, and then whatever has those the highest should give me the best margins

it also seems like the three older NA dcs tend to be quite a lot less expensive than dynamis, so i might also want to compare price data across the whole region
