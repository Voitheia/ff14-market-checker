### TODO
next thing to do would be to pick a certain amount of items, maybe the 100 highest velocity, and pull current market price data for those items for each of those items.

i could pull price history to see what those items usually sell at.

i need to get the delta between the lowest listed price within the dc and somewhere its listed high, and then whatever has those the highest should give me the best margins

it also seems like the three older NA dcs tend to be quite a lot less expensive than dynamis, so i might also want to compare price data across the whole region



calculate DC delta and region delta






## main page
list of top 100 most interesting items on market, use `index.html` template

### table

|  | Name | Velocity | Region Delta | DC Delta |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Item Icon | Item Name | velocity data (how<br>quickly its selling) | high/low price delta<br> within NA region | high/low price delta<br> within Dynamis |
| ![Fire Crystal](ff14_market_checker\delta_checker\static\icons\8.png) | Fire Crystal | 298764.30 | 10<br>80@Behemoth(Primal)<br>90@Kraken(Dynamis) | 5<br>85@Seraph(Dynamis)<br>90@Kraken(Dynamis) |

## item page
list more specific market data for an item, use `item.html` template
